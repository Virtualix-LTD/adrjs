## Context
This package will be distributed as an open-source command line tool. We need to
select the license under which the source code will become available.

## Decision
We will use the MIT license, as it is the one readily accepted by many
businesses, especially when concerned with adopting open source libraries or
tools within their projects.

## Consequences
None worth mentioning.
