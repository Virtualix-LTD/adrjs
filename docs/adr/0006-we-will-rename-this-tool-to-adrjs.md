# 0006. We will rename this tool to adrjs

Date: 2025-01-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context
This tool is meant to be invoked via npx, however, the `adr` package already
exists.

## Decision
We will rename this tool from `node-adr` to `adrjs`. This includes any references
to documentation and help pages. `adrjs` has all letters on the home row.

## Consequences
The package and its repository are currently unpublished, therefore there are
no major issues in dealing with updating external services or websites.
