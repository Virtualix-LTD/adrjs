# 0001. We will use the MIT license

Date: 2025-01-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context
This package will be distributed as an open-source command line
tool. We need to select the license under which the source code
will become available.

## Decision
We will use the MIT license, as it is the one readily accepted
by many businesses, especially when concerned with adopting open
source libraries or tools within their projects.

## Consequences
None worth mentioning.
