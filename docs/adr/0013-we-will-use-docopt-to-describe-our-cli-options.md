Date: 2025-01-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context
We need to document and display the commands and all parameters. This is tracked
in [issue #10](https://github.com/Virtualix-LTD/adrjs/issues/10).

## Decision
The format will conform to <http://docopt.org/>.

## Consequences
Our in-program help pages will follow a well-documented and concise format.
