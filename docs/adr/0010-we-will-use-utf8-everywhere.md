# 0010. We will use UTF-8 everywhere

Date: 2025-01-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context
We must decide on an encoding standard to ensure system cross-compatibility.

## Decision
We will use UTF-8 everywhere.

## Consequences
UTF-8 is already supported by every major OS and is, in many cases, the default
encoding. We will ensure it remains so in our tool.
